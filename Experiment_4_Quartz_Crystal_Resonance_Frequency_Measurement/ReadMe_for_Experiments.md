In the frequency range near the characteristic frequency of the crystal oscillator, input the voltage signal, measure and record the resonance signal at the corresponding frequency\
Change different temperatures, appropriately reduce the peak width (frequency range) while keeping the number of samples basically unchanged, and repeat the measurement

在晶体振荡器特征频率附近的频率区间内，输入电压信号，测量并记录对应频率下的共振信号\
改变不同的温度，在保持样本数基本不变的前提下适当缩小峰宽（频率范围），重复测量
